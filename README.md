# Easy Themes for ProtonMail
A collapsed CSS that's simple to edit by anyone.

### What's so special about this?

- This CSS is broken down into **7 "core" colors** that make it very simple to change to any colors of your choice!

```
:root {
/* Core Theme Colors */
    --theme1: #cd93cd;
    --theme2: #625062;
    --theme3: #f0e6f0;
    --theme4: #baabbf;
    --theme5: #7c6a7c;
    --theme6: #7e82b4;
    --theme7: #996699;
}
```
Just overwrite these colors with your favorites, or generate a pretty palette from https://coolors.co/

### Note

- This is only available for the web version and not the PM mobile apps.
- Some of these themes don't always appear the best. I apologize if they hurt your eyes.
- Dark theme is a bit difficult to edit the Compose popup because its in an iframe. I'm still trying to fix that.
