# Easy Themes for ProtonMail
A collapsed CSS that's simple to edit by anyone.

### What's so special about this?

- This CSS is broken down into **7 "core" colors** that make it very simple to change to any colors of your choice!

```
:root {
/* Core Theme Colors */
    --theme1: #9397cd;
    --theme2: #505061;
    --theme3: #e6eaf0;
    --theme4: #acb0bf;
    --theme5: #6a6f7c;
    --theme6: #7e82b4;
    --theme7: #66669a;
}
```
Just overwrite these colors with your favorites, or generate a pretty palette from https://coolors.co/
