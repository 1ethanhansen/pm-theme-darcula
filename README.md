# Easy Themes for ProtonMail
A collapsed CSS that's simple to edit by anyone.

### What's so special about this?

- This CSS is broken down into **7 "core" colors** that make it very simple to change to any colors of your choice!

```
:root {
/* Core Theme Colors */
    --theme1: #66669a;
    --theme2: #5f5f60;
    --theme3: #f0f0f0;
    --theme4: #bcbdbf;
    --theme5: #797a7c;
    --theme6: #9397cd;
    --theme7: #fefefe;
}
```
